# 🧠 PersonaScan – MBTI-Based Personality Detection System

## 🔍 Overview

**PersonaScan** is a machine learning-based personality detection system that predicts a user's MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) type from textual input. This project demonstrates how AI and NLP techniques can be applied to understand human personality using data-driven approaches.

The system uses a trained ML model integrated with a Django-based web interface. Users can input a paragraph of text, and the system returns the predicted personality type (e.g., INFP, ESTJ), along with an explanation and visual representation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

With the growing importance of personality analysis in fields like recruitment, personalized marketing, and mental health, traditional questionnaire-based MBTI assessments are time-consuming and rigid. This project replaces such manual effort by predicting MBTI types from free-form text input, using machine learning models trained on real-world social media data.
